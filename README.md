# multicore project
In this project, we compare two parallel programming languages -- OpenMP and Pthreads.
We would analyze the frameworks in four aspects: performance, scalability, running overhead and programmability. The experiments would be conducted using six benchmarks: Array accessing, linked list processing, matrix multiplication, LU matrix factorization, merge sort and ray tracing.

# Experimental Setup
we run our experiments on the crunchy 6 machine and use gcc-9.2 as the compiler.
